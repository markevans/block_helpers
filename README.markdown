Block Helpers
=============

When we write ERB views in Rails, etc., we generally DRY up the markup using helpers or partials.

However, it's quite common to overdo the 'DRYing up'.

When you find yourself passing in optional arguments to a helper/partial such as `:extra_text => 'eggs', :to_s_method => 'cheese'`, you know that there must be a better way.

Rails already has a great solution for forms with form-builders, using helpers which yield an object which can be used for further rendering.

This small gem generates helpers similar to the form-builders, but for the general case.

Installation
============

To use in Rails, add to your `environment.rb`:

    config.gem "block_helpers", :source => "http://gemcutter.org"

for Merb, in `init.rb`:

    dependency "block_helpers"

If using Rails 3.x, add to your Gemfile

    gem "block_helpers"

and run 'bundle install'.


Example usage
=============
Please note that these examples are very contrived just for brevity! These block helpers are much more useful than just printing 'Hi there Marmaduke!'

Simple case
-----------

In the helper file:

    module MyHelper
    
      class MyBlockHelper < BlockHelpers::Base
      
        def hello(name)
          "<p>Hi there #{name}!</p>"
        end
      
      end
    
    end

This has generated a helper called `my_block_helper`.
So in the view:

    <% my_block_helper do |h| %>
      Here goes...
      <%= h.hello('Marmaduke') %>
      ...hooray!
    <% end %>

This will generate the following:

    Here goes...
    <p>Hi there Marmaduke!</p>
    ...hooray!


Accessing other helper methods
------------------------------

Methods available in the parent helper are available to the block helper class.
In case of name clashes, you can also access those methods via the protected object `helper`.
In the helper:

    module MyHelper

      def angry
        "I'm very angry"
      end

      class MyBlockHelper < BlockHelpers::Base
  
        def angry
          content_tag :div, helper.angry
        end
  
      end

    end

In the view:

    <% my_block_helper do |h| %>
      <%= h.angry %>
    <% end %>

This generates:

    <div>I'm very angry</div>

Using arguments
---------------

You can pass in arguments to the helper, and these will be passed through to the class's `initialize` method.
In the helper:

    module MyHelper

      class MyBlockHelper < BlockHelpers::Base
  
        def initialize(tag_type)
          @tag_type = tag_type
        end
  
        def hello(name)
          content_tag @tag_type, "Hi there #{name}!"
        end
  
      end

    end

In the view:

    <% my_block_helper(:span) do |h| %>
      <%= h.hello('Marmaduke') %>
    <% end %>

This generates:

    <span>Hi there Marmaduke!</span>

Surrounding markup
------------------

Use the `display` method to surround the block with markup, e.g.
In the helper:

    module MyHelper

      class RoundedBox < BlockHelpers::Base

        def display(body)
          %(
            <div class="tl">
              <div class="tr">
                <div class="bl">
                  <div class="br">
                    #{body}
                  </div>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
          )
        end

      end

    end

In the view:

    <% rounded_box do %>
      Oi oi!!!
    <% end %>

This generates:

    <div class="tl">
      <div class="tr">
        <div class="bl">
          <div class="br">
            Oi oi!!!
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

Of course, you could use `display` for more than just surrounding markup.

Nesting
=======
You can even nest block helpers:

    module MyHelper

      class Nav < BlockHelpers::Base

        #...code....

        class SubNav < BlockHelpers::Base

          #...code...

        end

      end

    end

In the view:

    <% nav do |h| %>
      ...
      <% h.sub_nav do %>
        ...
      <% end %>
      ...
    <% end %>
    
However... I'd be careful not to abuse this, as the code could end up more confusing than it needs be.
Nested block helpers can access the parent block helper by using the `parent` method.

Testing
=======
I'm not too sure about other testing frameworks, but with rspec-rails you can use 'eval_erb', e.g.

    eval_erb(%(
      <% my_block_helper do |h| %>
        <h2>Hello</h2>
        <%= h.write_blah %>
      <% end %>
    )).should match_html("<h2>Hello</h2> blah blah blah ")

In the above I've used the following simple matcher `match_html`:

    def match_html(html)
      # Match two strings, but don't care about whitespace
      simple_matcher("should match #{html}"){|given| given.strip.gsub(/\s+/,' ').gsub('> <','><') == html.strip.gsub(/\s+/,' ').gsub('> <','><') }
    end

Obviously you test however you want but I've included the above in case it's useful.

Using with Rails 3
==================

Rails 3 uses a littlebit different helper block syntax than Rails 2.  (See the <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/208-erb-blocks-in-rails-3">screencast</a> from Ryan Bates for more details.)  In short: blocks need to be marked with <%= %> instead of <% %>.

Block_helpers will work as per the new syntax if run on Rails 3.  If you want it to fall back to the Rails 2 syntax (in Rails 3) redefine the rails2_compatibility_mode? method to return true (either at custom class level or at application level in an initializer).

Compatibility
=============
Currently it depends on activesupport, and requires that the helper already has the methods `concat` and `capture` available (which is the case in Rails and Merb).  Please, note, that ActiveSupport 3.1+ breaks the `capture` method (see <a href='https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/issues/168#issuecomment-4162727'>this comment</a> and <a href='https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/d4fa120671e989eecb71c14647dd2051d28de4a5#activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/kernel/reporting.rb'>this commit</a>).  Thus `capture` got replicated in the gem.

It works with both the one and two argument versions of `concat`, so should work with all recent versions of Rails and Merb.
